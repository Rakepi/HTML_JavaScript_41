        <p>My name is Nathan Price I was born in Waterville Maine in February. Growing up in maine was fun and the winters only made it better with the snowfall, althoigh I would say my favorite seaon is fall with the leaves changing. Halloween is my favorite holiday with all of it spooky decor but most of all for it traditional festivities not much what we do now with the candy. I am an artist and love sketching most of all, I am a gamer as well with my favorite games being League of Legends and a few of the older baulders gates games. I graduated highschool in Skowhegan Maine at the Skowhegan Area Highschool in 2015 and spent a few years working before making my choice to go back to school. Within the almost 5 years I wa out of school I worked in customer service and did a few more physically laborious jobs in factorys and working with a few outdoor companies. But by the end of those 5 years I found the passion I wanted to follow that I had lost after highschool and that was to be a game designer so I looked at a few schools and desided on the New England Institute of Tech (NEIT) in Rhode Island. With all that we are up to now and this page being written.
